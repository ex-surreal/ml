# ML

## What is this?

A pet project to build ML app. Currently, I'm not sure what to build. Main purpose of this project is to learn stuffs.
Especially Rust, and of course, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Model. Because you know,
These topics are so hot right now!

## Why tf Rust for a ML project?

Because I'm an adult, and I don't need a reason. And also, shut up!
